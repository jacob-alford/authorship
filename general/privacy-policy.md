## 1. Your Information

jalford.me collects your email and favourite colour strictly for authentication, identity in comments, and notifications about comment responses (not yet implemented).

## 2. Device Details

jalford.me may fallback to user-agent sniffing if the device platform isn't recognized by other more private means.  See [this Mozilla article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Browser_detection_using_the_user_agent) for more details.  These details are used to detect if you're on a mobile platform, and are used to prevent animated scrolling when it isn't apty supported.

Additionally, jalford.me performs standard CSS Media Queries to determine your preferred color-theme (e.g. light/dark mode), and your accessibility preferences (e.g. prefer-reduced-motion).

jalford.me does not collect any other identifiable information.

## 3. Children Under the Age of 13

jalford.me is not intended for children under 13 years of age.  jalford.me does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.  If you are under 13, please do not provide any information on jalford.me

## 4. Cookies are delicious but scary, do you do any of that?

jalford.me sets tokens in local-storage if your preferred colour theme changes (e.g. light/dark mode). 

Additionally, other stored values are values stored by Firebase, or files stored in cache as per Google's Progressive Web App standards.

## 5. Can I delete everything?

You can request to delete your account at a special email:

## 6. I have more questions, where can I contact you?

Here's a special email so I can swiftly and assuredly address any concerns that may arise:

## 7. I live in California, what about that?

If you are a California resident, you can learn more about your consumer privacy rights by reviewing the [California Privacy Notice](https://help.instagram.com/2482657248648591).

## 8. WHAT IF THIS CHANGES???

I will not spam your inbox with just another "oUR pRiVacY poLicY hAS cHanGED."  If you want to see an up to date version [click here](https://jalford.me/posts/privacy-policy).  The last updated date can be found at the top.  But honestly, I won't change it much.

## 9. Do you sell my data?

No.

## 10. Do you have any insight into companies that *do* sell my data?
