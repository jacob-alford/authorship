# A Birch Abandon

### May 17, 2019

****

The train hit a bump and Duncan was jolted awake. He glanced around. "A train?" he thought. The last train to be used, as he recalled, was before - and during - the war. The war was perhaps the most bittersweet moment in human history. Human suffering, at least a vast majority of it, ended alongside the conflict, and alongside an estimated 4.6 billion human lives. Though Duncan had forgotten most of it, like most of history class, that number - 4.6 - he had never forgotten.

Since then, a lot has happened on Anther. The world's religions erased. The world's countries destroyed. Anther entered a miniature ice age; and many died still. Once everybody discovered cooperation, Anther began anew; Anther experienced no murder, no theft, no assault. Anther thrived. There was no longer any need for trains; private logistics and inexpensive electricity deprecated that need. But yet here Duncan sat, on a train.

The train came to a halt, and about half of the people around Duncan began to leave for the station. He looked to his left, there was a woman who was seated with her husband. Through the bustle of the departing travelers he caught a glimpse. She displayed an exorbitant red dress, wore a stunning pearl necklace, and held a ring with a diamond that seemed almost too large to carry. He was wearing a suit, and had atop his head a hat. It was a peculiar hat - it was tall and cylindrical, and carried a button that bore some form of political jargon. Duncan strained to read it, "We the people will win!" The 'we' and the 'win' were particularly large, at least relative to the pin altogether. The man also carried a cane, with what appeared to be a large red gem on the top. The cane rested precariously against the table half jutting into the path.

"But honey that dress was so drab, the thought of seeing it on you simply abhors me," said the man with the funny hat.

"Yes but darling do let us be blunt, you simply couldn't afford it - and at least it's not as drab as that silly hat, how much was that anyway?"

"Maybe I would have made an exception if you hadn't been acting so distant. I see no need to allow you the choice."

"It was far more than you could afford, if I recall," the woman rolled her eyes, and in so doing caught Duncan's meddling. Duncan did not look away, but persisted with pure curiosity. The man got up and started toward the restroom, forgetting his cane, "Do be patient my dear, perhaps we'll find you something that won't scare away the lepers."

The woman maintained eye contact, and smiled. All at once, she jumped out of her seat, grabbed the cane, and headed for the exit.

"What a funny exchange," Duncan thought to himself. He looked out the window to his right toward the station. He saw the woman headed for a bright yellow car. But the car wasn't any car that Duncan was accustomed to, it was round, and didn't have many angles. It looked ancient.

The train started moving again. Duncan suddenly felt very tired, and laid his head on the table.

Duncan woke again, but something was off. He didn't hear any conversations, no laughter, no bustle; just the rhythmic clacking of steel on the tracks. He opened his eyes and looked around. He couldn't see a soul. He got up and headed toward the front of the train. He crossed the admittedly terrifying gap between train-cars, and looked around. There was no one in this car either. He continued to the front of the train. Duncan found the door to the engine car wide open, and he entered. He looked around and saw levers, gauges, and a little strung cable - but no conductor. There wasn't a soul here either. He walked through the exterior door that connected the engine car with the platform that wrapped around the front of the train. He looked around and gasped. He was surrounded by birch trees, large birch trees; they were burning, the forest was on fire! Duncan realized that he was very hot, he felt himself sweating. He was about to turn around when he glanced forward. The tracks lead straight into a brick wall, a wall so large that the top was obscured by the thick smoke that enveloped him. He desperately searched the wall for a tunnel, but could find not a single one. He felt the urge to rush inside, to grab the brake, to stop the train. But he didn't. Duncan stopped. Duncan realized that his efforts would be in vain. Duncan looked forward, and closed his eyes. Right as the train smashed into the wall, Duncan lurched out of his bed gasping for breath. He sat upright breathing heavily.

"Bad dream?" There was a naked woman in front of him, getting dressed. He sighed, and laid back down. "You want us to charge the account like usual?" Duncan nodded. The girl tiptoed out of the room. Duncan turned on his side, closing his eyes.

Kathryn turned the burger over. She always hated how appealing burgers were. She hated how much she loved them. But she decided that some occasions were cause for intemperance; she pressed the spatula down on the burger - grease flooded the grill and made a satisfying sssssssssizzle.

"Those smell great, babe!" Daniel commented, embracing his wife from behind.

"Thanks honey," she replied kissing him. It was rare that they spent time together outdoors, the kids often did; Danny had many friends, as did his sister Ella. But today was Peace Day, and she wanted to make sure they were spending Peace Day together under the warm embrace of the sun.

"You think your brother is going to make it?" Daniel asked.

"He missed it last year, I doubt he'll make it this year. But it sure would be nice to have him around." Kathryn replied.

"Yeeeaaaahhh!!! Uncle Duncan!!!" Danny cried!

Ella joined in, "Dun-can, Dun-can, Dun-can," they chanted.

"I got a call from him last week - sometime around midnight - I think he may be pretty tied up with a case." Daniel recalled.

"Let me call him," Kathryn suggested. She pulled the processor out of her pocket, and tapped the photo of her brother. The photo was a couple years old - it was taken when they first started talking again. For years they had avoided contacting one another. She could remember the conversation clearly:

"Duncan, we're starting a family. You haven't centered yourself - you have too many bad habits. I can't start a family with that kind of influence."

"Kathryn listen, I know we grew up separately, I know we've had our differences, but your kids should know their uncle! I have so much to teach them!" Duncan pleaded.

"I would love for you to know them, but you have to make some changes first. I'm afraid these are not up for negotiation." Kathryn held firm.

"Oh what, what should I change Kathryn?"

"You have to control yourself, this nightly whoring, I know it's been happening - and it has to stop. My children deserve a teacher who knows that love isn't some kind of pleasure game; knows what's honorable and respectable; knows how one should act, what's right, what's wrong."

"I didn't have the privilege you did, Kathryn! You won the parent lottery, I was stuck with cold schoolmasters! Every night the only thing I had was the thought of one day getting out, one day being free."

"I know you've been through a lot, but you have a long way to come. I'm sorry Duncan."

Duncan answered her call, snapping her out of the vivid memory. "Kathryn?" Duncan asked. She wondered how long she had been absent.

"Duncan, how are you?" She asked.

"I'm okay, didn't sleep too well last night," he answered.

"I'm sorry to hear that. We were hoping that you'd make it to our cookout, the kids are begging! We'll probably start around noon."

"I'm afraid I can't today, this case has been heating up and I worry that if I stop I'll miss something important."

"Oh that's too bad, but I'm sure you're doing what you think is best."

"Give the kids a hug for me, will you?"

"They're here if you want to say hi!"

"Oh yes, put them on!"

Kathryn walked over to the table and handed the processor to the kids.

"Duncan, are you still in bed?" Ella said giggling, still missing a few baby teeth soon to be replaced.

"Oh yes, very busy you see, late night - all for finding the bad guys!" Duncan smiled.

"You shouldn't waste your morning, Duncan!" Danny said earnestly.

"Yes Danny, you are quite right - I'll be getting up soon. You two enjoy Peace Day! Have they taught you what it's about?"

"It's about everybody getting along and working with each other instead of fighting!" Ella answered dutifully.

"That's it, exactly! Now don't forget it!" Duncan said sitting up and pointing as if he was right there with them. "I'll see you guys soon!"

"Okay, Duncan!" The kids said in unison.

"Now I'm going to get to work, you two give your mom a hug and kiss for me!" Duncan smiled, and ended the call.

Danny handed the processor to his mom. "Mom, why can't Duncan visit more?"

"Duncan has a lot to worry about son. But he loves you two very much. I'm sure he's sad that he couldn't make it."

"Honey, I can't seem to find the ice cream!" Daniel shouted from inside.

"Oh shoot, I must have forgotten it!" Kathryn said. "Perhaps we can find something else instead?" She posited.

"Ahh come on Kathryn, a little treat every once in a while is good for a person; gives them a reward for all of their dedication!"

"Yeah mom, ice cream! Ice cream! Ice cream!" The kids chanted, exercising their newfound pastime.

"Alright, I suppose now's the best day if any." she relented.

"Yaaaaayyyyy!" The kids cheered.

"I'll head to the store and be back quicker than ever!" Kathryn smiled.

"I'll tend the burgers while your gone," Daniel said kissing Kathryn.

Kathryn spent some time choosing which ice cream to buy. She wanted to balance the size of the container and the price. Fortunately, there was no shortage of options. She ended up choosing the one that looked the healthiest, though it certainly wasn't. She headed for the front, but something was amiss. Everybody was standing still, everybody was silent. Standing on her tippy toes, she caught a glimpse of something she wished she hadn't. Before her stood three men dressed in black with what appeared to be bags of white powder strapped to their chests. Her heart jumped. She turned around and hid behind an aisle. Fumbling in her pocket, she grasped at her processor. She yanked it out, lowered the volume, and called the only person she could think of.

Duncan answered with "now you're bragging about the food are you?" But he immediately noticed something was off. Kathryn appeared visually distraught. "Wait what's the matter, where are you?"

Breathing purposefully now, Kathryn whispered "Duncan, I'm at Peace Time Produce, the one nearby my house, three men have entered with what appear to be bombs strapped to their chests!"

"Stay right there, I'll be over with help! Keep the line on, but hide the phone!"

Kathryn complied, but things appeared grim. She overheard the men at the front start to give a speech.

"For years we have hid in the shadows. For years we have watched you live. You think you are safe? You think you can live in peace? We are the Peacebreakers, and we will steal from you that which you stole from us!"

Kathryn picked the phone back up, "Duncan, I don't think we have long."

"Just hang in there Kathryn, I'm on my way!" Duncan was in his car and moving. The processor in his car droned, "You will arrive in three minutes and forty-seven seconds." "Four minutes out!" He relayed. Duncan's engine roared. Normally the owners of the throughport didn't allow such reckless driving, but he opened the line on his car and explained the situation.

"Of course detective, we'll alert the other drivers right away." The throughport operator assured.

Almost instantly the other drivers on the road started pulling onto the shoulder. But Duncan didn't have time to notice, he had to get there, and fast.

The men dressed in black continued, "All of Anther will watch - there will be no peace. Today is the first day of a new era - an era of fear. And fate has chosen you. Rejoice, a new dawn has come, and you its kindle."

"Duncan," Kathryn said. "I need you to promise me,"

"No, I'm almost there, you're going home to your family. I promise you this." Duncan said tearing up.

"Promise me you'll tell them I love them, and will always love them."

"No, I can't,"

"Promise me!"

"Alright, I promise!"

"Duncan, be the man I know you can be. I love you Duncan, I always have."

By this point Duncan had pulled up to the store, and was rushing toward the entrance readying his firearm. He could almost catch the final words of the speech.

"Rejoice, Rejoice!" The suited men cried!

But Duncan didn't reach the front. As there wasn't a front to be reached. Duncan was too late. As he was running the entire building went up in flames, the doors burst open, glass shattered, ground shaking, walls collapsed. And before he could react one of the door frames ripped off and hurled straight for him knocking him unconscious.

At home, Daniel heard the blast and quickly dialed Kathryn. There was no answer. This Peace Day was all too broken.
